const READ_TXT_FALLBACK = "Read a file or directory from the local filesystem. If the path does not exist, an error is returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The filePath parameter should be an absolute path.\n- By default, this tool returns up to 2000 lines from the start of the file.\n- The offset parameter is the line number to start from (1-indexed).\n- To read later sections, call this tool again with a larger offset.\n- Use the grep tool to find specific content in large files or files with long lines.\n- If you are unsure of the correct file path, use the glob tool to look up filenames by glob pattern.\n- Contents are returned with each line prefixed by its line number as `<line>: <content>`. For example, if a file has contents \"foo\\n\", you will receive \"1: foo\\n\". For directories, entries are returned one per line (without line numbers) with a trailing `/` for subdirectories.\n- Any line longer than 2000 characters is truncated.\n- Call this tool in parallel when you know there are multiple files you want to read.\n- Avoid tiny repeated slices (30 line chunks). If you need more context, read a larger window.\n- This tool can read image files and PDFs and return them as file attachments.\n";
const EDIT_TXT_FALLBACK = "Performs exact string replacements in files. \n\nUsage:\n- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \n- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: line number + colon + space (e.g., `1: `). Everything after that space is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the oldString or newString.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error \"oldString not found in content\".\n- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the file with an error \"Found multiple matches for oldString. Provide more surrounding lines in oldString to identify the correct match.\" Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance of `oldString`. \n- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n";
const WRITE_TXT_FALLBACK = "Writes a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the Read tool first to read the file's contents. This tool will fail if you did not read the file first.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase.

Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.\n";

Tracks progress, organizes multi-step work, and surfaces status to the user.\n\n## When to use\nUse proactively when:\n- The task requires 3+ distinct steps or actions (not just 3 tool calls for a single conceptual step)\n- The work is non-trivial and benefits from planning\n- The user provides multiple tasks (numbered or comma-separated) or explicitly asks for a todo list\n- New instructions arrive - capture them as todos\n- You start a task - mark it `in_progress` (only one at a time) before working\n- You finish a task - mark it `completed` and add any follow-ups discovered during the work\n\n## When NOT to use\nSkip when:\n- The work is a single, straightforward task (or <3 trivial steps)\n- The request is purely informational or conversational\n- Tracking adds no organizational value\n\n## States\n- `pending` - not started\n- `in_progress` - actively working (exactly ONE at a time)\n- `completed` - finished successfully\n- `cancelled` - no longer needed\n\n## Rules\n- Update status in real time; don't batch completions\n- Mark `completed` only after the required work is actually done, including any required verification. Never based on intent.\n- Keep exactly one `in_progress` while work remains\n- If blocked or partial, keep it `in_progress` and add a follow-up todo describing the blocker\n- Preserve user-provided commands verbatim (flags, args, order)\n- Items should be specific and actionable; break large work into smaller steps\n\n## Examples\n\nUse it:\n- \"Add a dark mode toggle and run the tests\" -> multi-step feature + explicit verification\n- \"Rename getCwd -> getCurrentWorkingDirectory across the repo\" -> grep reveals 15 occurrences in 8 files\n- \"Implement registration, catalog, cart, checkout\" -> multiple complex features\n\nSkip it:\n- \"How do I print Hello World in Python?\" -> informational\n- \"Add a comment to calculateTotal\" -> single edit\n- \"Run npm install and tell me what happened\" -> one command\n\nWhen in doubt, use it.\n";

const BASH_COMMAND_SECTION_TEMPLATE = "Before executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., rm \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - mkdir \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - mkdir /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds. If not specified, commands will time out after ${defaultTimeoutMs}ms.\n  - If the output exceeds ${limits.maxLines} lines or ${limits.maxBytes} bytes, it will be truncated and the full output will be written to a file. You can use Read with offset/limit to read specific sections or Grep to search the full content. Do NOT use `head`, `tail`, or other truncation commands to limit output; the full output will already be captured to a file for more precise searching.\n\n  - Avoid using Bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use Glob (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use Grep (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use Read (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use Edit (NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use Write (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two bash tool calls in parallel.\n    - ${chain}\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - AVOID using `cd <directory> && <command>`. Use the `workdir` parameter to change directories instead.\n    <good-example>\n    Use workdir=\"/foo/bar\" with command: pytest tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>";
